- K-medoid algorithm for clustering uncertain data using KL-Divergence as probability distribution similarity is implemented in this project.
- The IEEE paper based on which this project has been implemented is added as IEEE_paper.pdf in the 'src' folder.
- A sample dataset WalesRainfall.data to test the algorithm is also added in the 'src' folder.
- To test the algorithm, run the Test.java file and enter the path of the dataset,number of clusters required and the path where the clustered datasets must be created.
- The algorithm is described in the section 4.1.2 in IEEE_paper.pdf
- Equations from the sections 3.3. and 3.1 in the paper have also been used in this project.
